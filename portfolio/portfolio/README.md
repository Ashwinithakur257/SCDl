# Portfolio

A clean, responsive, and ready-to-edit personal portfolio.

## Quick start
- Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
- Edit text in `index.html` (name, bio, links).
- Adjust theme colors in `styles.css` under `:root` and `:root.light`.
- Add your photo at `assets/profile.jpg`.
- Add your CV at `assets/cv.pdf` (the Download CV button points here).

## Features
- **Bootstrap 5** via CDN for components and responsive utilities.
- **Responsive layout** with grid-based sections.
- **Dark/Light mode** with toggle and localStorage.
- **Sections**: Hero, About Us, Skills, Projects, Links, Experience, Contact.
- **Accessible**: semantic HTML, labels, focus styles.

## Customize
- Update initials and name in `index.html` (`logo`, `.avatar`, footer name).
- Update socials in footer.
- Add your projects inside the `#projects` section.
- Add roles in the `#experience` section.

## Contact form
By default it opens your email client via `mailto:`. For a backend form service later, hook into `script.js` submit handler.

## Structure
```
C:/Users/Dell/CascadeProjects/portfolio/
├─ index.html
├─ styles.css
├─ script.js
├─ favicon.svg
└─ assets/
   └─ README.md
```

## Recommended next step
Set this folder as your active workspace in the IDE, then edit `index.html` placeholders.
